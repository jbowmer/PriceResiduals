This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#read in the data
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
setwd("/Users/Jake/Projects/MarketValuation/Data/")

cpi = read.csv("cpi.csv")
cpi$Date = as.Date(as.character(cpi$Date), format = "%d/%m/%Y")
cpi = cpi[c(1,2)]
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
